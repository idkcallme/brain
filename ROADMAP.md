# Roadmap and Development Checklist

This roadmap expands on the high level checklist to provide concrete tasks and guidance for contributors. Each section lists short‑term items as well as longer term ideas. The order is not strictly chronological.

## 1. Documentation and Usability
- **Setup guides**
  - Create `requirements.txt` describing Python dependencies.
  - Add instructions for creating a virtual environment and installing the package in editable mode.
  - Document optional dependencies for the example server.
- **Architecture overview**
  - Diagram how `Brain`, `GoalManager`, and `ReasoningLoop` interact.
  - Include a directory tree with brief descriptions of each module.
- **Usage examples**
  - Provide interactive CLI examples demonstrating memory recall and goal management.
  - Show how to run the FastAPI server and send requests.
- **Developer onboarding**
  - Explain code style preferences and testing workflow.
  - Add a quick‑start page linking to key modules and design notes.

## 2. Advanced Reasoning and Understanding
- **Interpretation improvements**
  - Implement basic natural language parsing or integrate an external LLM service.
  - Store parsed representations in semantic memory for later reasoning.
- **Planning and multi‑step reasoning**
  - Allow goals to generate sub‑goals when complex tasks are detected.
  - Add a scheduler that keeps track of partially completed plans.
- **Action selection**
  - Support multiple types of actions (e.g. tool use, communication, reflection).
  - Add a priority mechanism so urgent actions can override others.
- **World modelling**
  - Maintain simple contextual facts about the agent's environment and internal state.
  - Use this model when evaluating goals and deciding on next actions.

## 3. Learning and Adaptation
- **Feedback loops**
  - Expand `FeedbackProcessor` to adjust memory routing and goal priorities based on success or failure.
  - Record feedback events in episodic memory for analysis.
- **Reinforcement learning**
  - Train a small Q‑table or lightweight model to choose memory stores and retrieval strategies.
  - Extend the approach to influence which goals are pursued next.

## 4. Memory System Enhancements
- **Consolidation policies**
  - Make short‑term and episodic thresholds configurable at runtime.
  - Experiment with decay functions that gradually forget rarely used memories.
- **Retrieval quality**
  - Add cosine similarity search to the semantic store for vector queries.
  - Consider context‑aware retrieval that factors in current goals or conversation history.
- **Persistence**
  - Allow export and import of memory snapshots to disk.
  - Provide utilities for inspecting stored memories for debugging purposes.

## 5. Goal and Belief Management
- **Belief representation**
  - Track confidence scores and relationships between beliefs.
  - Implement belief revision when contradictory information is perceived.
- **Dynamic goal creation**
  - Let the reasoning loop spawn new goals based on interpreted input.
  - Support expiration of goals that are no longer relevant.
- **Conflict handling**
  - Detect conflicting goals and decide which to prioritize or drop.
  - Surface unresolved conflicts through the API for user intervention.

## 6. Safety, Ethics, and Boundaries
- **Expanded safeguards**
  - Monitor for self‑referential modifications beyond the file system, such as code injection.
  - Audit memory exports to ensure no sensitive data leaves the agent unintentionally.
- **Ethical decision making**
  - Include an ethics module that checks planned actions against a list of forbidden behaviors.
  - Allow configurable ethical profiles for different use cases.
- **Emergency controls**
  - Add an HTTP endpoint to trigger graceful shutdown from the outside.
  - Document procedures for manual intervention if the agent misbehaves.

## 7. Testing and Quality Assurance
- **Test coverage**
  - Write unit tests for each memory component and reasoning step.
  - Add integration tests that simulate short interactive sessions.
- **Continuous integration**
  - Configure a GitHub Actions workflow running `pytest` and formatting checks.
  - Display build status badges in the README.

## 8. Community and Contribution
- **Guidelines**
  - Provide a `CONTRIBUTING.md` explaining how to file issues and submit PRs.
  - Add a `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` to set expectations for behavior.
- **Templates**
  - Create issue and pull request templates in `.github/` for consistent reports.
  - Encourage discussions in GitHub Discussions or a community chat.

## 9. Licensing
- Decide on a permissive license (e.g. MIT) or a copyleft license (e.g. GPL) and add the file to the repository.
- Clarify copyright ownership in each source file header if needed.

## 10. Roadmap and Limitations
- **Public roadmap**
  - Keep this document up to date with completed items and upcoming milestones.
  - Outline long‑term aspirations, such as multi‑agent experiments or integration with other frameworks.
- **Known limitations**
  - Document current shortcomings (e.g. simplistic reasoning, lack of persistence).
  - Explicitly list features that are out of scope for the project.
