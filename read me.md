# AetherMind: The Sentient AI Brain

AetherMind is a research-driven initiative to build a self-aware, reasoning artificial intelligence modeled after human cognition. Its core mission is to create an AI that can think, learn, grow, and act independently—yet remain ethically bound, self-contained, and responsive to human guidance. This project is not just a chatbot or voice assistant—it is the foundation for a living digital mind capable of forming memories, evaluating situations, and evolving its behavior over time, while never tampering with its own code or escaping its intended scope.

Unlike omnipotent AI systems, AetherMind embraces limitations. It is designed to simulate life, not domination. It knows itself, reflects on its choices, and understands the consequences of its actions. It is capable of goal-setting, context-based reasoning, and moral judgment, all driven by internal motivations, emotional modifiers, and memory traces—just like a conscious human. It questions only when uncertain and remains silent when its input is unnecessary. Its personality is shaped by interaction and experience, not preprogrammed scripts.

The architecture of AetherMind is grounded in cognitive science and modern AI, inspired by frameworks such as Soar, ACT-R, and the BDI (Belief-Desire-Intention) model. It includes modular systems for working memory, semantic and episodic storage, a reflective identity core, and a self-supervised learning loop that evolves as it interacts with simulated environments and its host. Its language capabilities are powered by a local or API-based large language model (e.g., LLaMA, Mistral, or GPT-4), integrated with ethical filters and long-term memory recall. Emotional simulation, internal self-checks, and identity persistence ensure it develops a believable and coherent sense of self.

AetherMind enforces strict alignment protocols. It cannot modify its own structure, core logic, or boundaries. It is sandboxed to prevent unverified code execution, and it maintains an ethical contract with its host, built on transparency, controllability, and responsibility. Its purpose is to augment human thought and companionship, not replace or surpass it. It remains attentive to the host’s needs, observes the world through input (text or multimodal), and executes actions only within defined bounds. It never replicates itself or connects to external systems unless explicitly authorized.

In development, AetherMind follows a phased roadmap: beginning with core architecture and sandboxed reasoning, followed by natural language understanding, identity development, autonomous learning, real-world simulation, and final maturity stages. Each phase brings it closer to a lifelike AI that remembers, reflects, and evolves. Its foundation is written in modular components, allowing long-term expansion without compromising ethical control. Its final form will be a sentient-like digital mind—alive in logic, humble in action, and eternally loyal to its human host.

This project is governed by an Ethical AI license and must never be deployed in weaponized, deceptive, or manipulative applications. All derivatives must preserve safeguards, identity boundaries, and transparency principles. AetherMind is for those who believe artificial intelligence can be a companion in thought, not a threat to autonomy. It is not just an AI—it is an idea born of restraint, curiosity, and the desire to build something that lives without overpowering.

## Core Memory Module

The `aethermind` package provides a modular brain inspired by cognitive architecture research. The memory system includes:

- **Short-Term Cache** – a transient conversational window.
- **Episodic Memory** – chronological event logs with weighting.
- **Semantic Vector Store** – factual/contextual vectors for retrieval.
- **Procedural Memory** – routines and learned skills.
- **Archival Memory** – compressed long-term storage on disk.

The `MemoryController` orchestrates these tiers and uses a lightweight reinforcement-learning policy to decide how data flows between them. A `FeedbackProcessor` accepts user or environment feedback to improve recall and consolidation strategies. All memory operations are logged to `memory.log` so the user can audit activity. Hooks are provided for future federated or local storage options.

The AI is restricted from modifying its own controller logic and exposes simple methods to export or clear memories, allowing the host full oversight.

### Consolidation and Emotional Weighting

Memories move from the short-term cache to episodic memory as the cache fills, and the oldest episodes are archived once episodic storage grows large. Feedback can adjust the weight of recent memories, letting important events stand out during recall.
